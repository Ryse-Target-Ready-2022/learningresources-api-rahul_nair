# learningresources-api-rahul_nair
Added service package and wrote unit tests for the method in LearningResourceService class.
An extra method getProfitMargin has been added for unit testing.
In the previous iteration the sortedlearningResources method was returning TreeMap data structure with keys as profit margin and values as the class LearningResource.
